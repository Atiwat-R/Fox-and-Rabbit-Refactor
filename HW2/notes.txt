-- My own additions --

+ I'm making new abstract class Carnivore, 
which extends Animal. Tiger and Fox will extend Carnivore

+ To service findFood() and easier task of changing
a Carnivore's prey, I'm making HashSet<Class> preyNames 
in each Carnivore. Each will contains what 
that animal it can eat.

+ Changed findFood(), which is now in Carnivore, to
compare nearby object via class instead of using instanceof.

+ It is now possible to change what a carnivore can eat by
only changing preyNames() of each Animal.

+ RABBIT_FOOD_VALUE is in reality the highest one's
food level can go. Initially, it is used to randomize
an animal's food level at spawn, then resets to max after
each time it consumes a meal (e.g. Rabbit)

+ I'll call it MAX_FOOD_LEVEL. Will deal with it soon.
